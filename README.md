# mpox-engage-sex-networks
Code to analyze data on sexual networks and its impacts on mpox transmission during the 2022-2023 outbreak.

The results are presented in the pre-print titled _[Characteristics of the sexual networks of gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men in Montr√©al, Toronto, and Vancouver: implications for the transmission and control of mpox in Canada](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.31.23294912v1)_.

## code structure
Briefly, the first number in the file prefix means the following
- `1`: descriptive analyses,
- `2`: main analyses (degree distribution, mpox _R<sub>0</sub>_ estimation), and
- `3`: sensitivity and supplementary analyses (alternative outcome: anal partnerships, restriction, covariate standardization), mpox _R<sub>e</sub>_ from mpox incidence data.

The second number is simply to maintain files in order.

NB: _R<sub>0</sub>_ is the basic reproduction number and _R<sub>e</sub>_ is the effective or instantaneous reproduction number.

### descriptive analyses
- [`11_descr_table1.R`](11_descr_table1.R) produces [__Table 1__](out/manuscript-tables/table_1_unadj_rds.csv) (correlates of & summary statistics of number of partners).
- [`12_descr_retention_ipcw.R`](12_descr_retention_ipcw.R) computes the IPCWs (details in Supplementary Materials section _RDS-II weights and inverse probability of censoring weights_) and produces [__Table S3__]((out/manuscript-tables/table_S3_retention.csv)) (retention of participants).
- [`13_descr_phac_mpox_data.R`](13_descr_phac_mpox_data.R) subsets and formats the mpox incidence data from PHAC ([link](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/mpox/)).

### main analyses
- Scripts `21` through `23` fit the negative binomial regression models ([`21_distr_fit_negbin_coef.R`](21_distr_fit_negbin_coef.R)), perform the post-stratification ([`src-stan/regression_negbin_aggregate.stan`](src-stan/regression_negbin_aggregate.stan)), and compute the fitted population-wide distribution of the number of sexual partners based on the post-stratified samples (script [`22_distr_fit_negbin_predictive.R`](22_distr_fit_negbin_predictive.R)).
	- Script [`21`](21_distr_fit_negbin_coef.R) also produces [__Table S4__](out/manuscript-tables/table_S4_coef_post.csv) (regression coefficients).
	- The post-stratification procedure is explained in detail in Supplementary Materials section _Distribution of sexual partner numbers (Bayesian regression and post-stratification)_.
	- [`23_distr_fit_negbin_figs.R`](23_distr_fit_negbin_figs.R) generates [__Figure 1__](fig/fig_1_cdf_main_model.png) (CDF of the number of sexual partners in P6M in each city) and [__Figure S1__](fig/fig_S1_cdf_model_fit_to_data.png) (model fit).

- Scripts `24` through `27` compute the mpox _R<sub>0</sub>_ using the next-generation matrix (NGM).
	- [`24_r0_categorize_pmf.R`](24_r0_categorize_pmf.R) partitions the population into sexual activity groups with pre-specified sizes (as a % of the total population), based on the estimated distributions from `21`&ndash;`23` (__Table S7__).
	- [`25_r0_seir_model.R`](25_r0_seir_model.R) computes the mpox _R<sub>0</sub>_ in two steps:
		1. A SEIR-type model is calibrated to public mpox incidence data (formatted in `13`) in order to estimate natural history parameters (__Table S2__). (See Supplementary Materials section _Reproduction number using a risk-stratified deterministic SEIR model and the next-generation matrix_ for model equations, [`src/seir_fns.R`](src/seir_fns.R) for model code).
		2. The NGM method is used to compute the mpox _R<sub>0</sub>_ based on the fitted distribution of sexual partner numbers estimated above and the city-specific parameters estimated with the SEIR model. This script also computes the _R<sub>e</sub>_ assuming set proportions of the population are immune (in the highest-activity groups), and projects the mpox _R<sub>0</sub>_ and _R<sub>e</sub>_ based on pre-COVID-19 sexual activity levels.
	- From the results produced by `25`, [`26_r0_seir_outputs.R`](26_r0_seir_outputs.R) generates [__Figure 2__](fig/fig_2_seir_model_fit.png) (SEIR model fit) and [__Figure 3__](fig/fig_2_seir_model_fit.png) (_R<sub>0</sub>_ and _R<sub>e</sub>_ based on the NGM method).
	- As a comaprison to the main results based on the NGM, [`27_r0_growth_rate.R`](27_r0_growth_rate.R) computes the mpox _R<sub>0</sub>_ based on the growth-rate in reported mpox cases over time, presented in [__Table S5__](out/manuscript-tables/table_S5_r0_estim_cases.csv).
		- This script also produces [__Figure S2__](fig/fig_2_r0_main.png) (cumulative mpox incidence in each province).

### sensitivity and supplementary analyses
- [`31_supp_restriction.R`](31_supp_restriction.R) performs the restriction sensitivity analysis, which fits the regression models restricting the analytical sample to participants who had visits at all three timepoints. Results are in [__Figure S3__](fig/fig_S3_cdf_main_vs_restriction.png).
- [`32_supp_standardization.R`](32_supp_standardization.R) performs the regression-based standardization. Results are in [__Figure S4__](fig/fig_S4_cdf_main_vs_standardization.png).
- Scripts `21` through `23` described in the previous section can be modified to use the alternative anal partners in P6M outcome variable, or to use a zero-inflated negative binomial model for the main outcome variable. Results are shown in [__Figure S5__](fig/fig_S5_cdf_main_all_vs_anal.png) and [__Figure S6__](fig/fig_S6_cdf_main_vs_zinf.png), respectively.
- [`33_supp_sensitivity_figs.R`](33_supp_sensitivity_figs.R) generates __Figures S3&ndash;S6__ from the analyses described above.
- [`34_supp_rt_case.R`](34_supp_rt_case.R) estimates the _R<sub>e</sub>_ using the _EpiEstim_ package, and results of which are shown in [__Figure S7__](fig/fig_S7_rt.png).
